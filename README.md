## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root to configure the following variables:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/tribook?retryWrites=true&w=majority
SESSION_SECRET=<your_secure_secret>
PORT=3000
```

### Tips:
- **MongoDB URI**: Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your actual MongoDB credentials. You can use MongoDB Atlas for cloud database hosting.
- **Session Secret**: Generate a secure session secret by running:
	```bash
	node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
	```

## 🔍 Detailed Functionality

### 1. **Reservation System**:
   - Users can browse available apartments and book them based on availability. 
   - The reservation process involves selecting a start and end date for the booking, which must fit within the apartment’s available date range. Once reserved, the apartment’s availability is updated.

### 2. **User Authentication**:
   - Users can create accounts or log in with existing credentials. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt, and session management ensures users stay logged in across requests.
   - Admins have separate privileges and can access routes that regular users cannot, such as managing apartments and viewing all reservations.

### 3. **Admin Panel**:
   - Admins have access to an admin dashboard that displays a list of reservations and apartments. They can create new apartment listings, modify existing ones, or remove them entirely. The admin panel also shows reservation details, including the client’s email, dates, and apartment information.
   - Admins can cancel any reservation, freeing up apartment availability.

### 4. **Apartment Management**:
   - Admins can add detailed information about apartments, including the number of rooms, price per night, amenities (e.g., WiFi, air conditioning), and available dates. Multiple photos can be uploaded for each apartment.
   - Apartments can be edited and deactivated if they are no longer available.

### 5. **Flash Messaging**:
   - Users are provided with real-time feedback on their actions (e.g., successful reservation, login errors). These messages disappear after viewing.
